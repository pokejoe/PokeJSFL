	UnJapanese
	Translates Japanese objects to English, and replaces full-width alphanumerics with normal "half-width" characters.

	WARNINGS: 
		Does not adjust Hiragana, Katakana, or Kanji.
		
		The Flash library structure uses a dash "-" to delineate folders in names. Because of the way JSFL accesses the name property, I cut off names before the dash, so do not use them in object names!
		
		If you undo immediately after running the script, it will undo the renaming successfully, but it will also flatten your library's directory structure. This is another result of the above ugliness. Better to save first and revert if necessary.
		
		If this script (or any with Japanese characters in it) does not run, check the encoding. Shift-JIS worked for me.
		
	Feature request:
		Replace all instances of a name with Kanji, Hiragana, Katakana included with a new name like "KanjiObj"
