/*
	UnJapanese
	Translates Japanese-named default objects to English, replaces full-width alphanumerics with normal "half-width" characters, and replaces all remaining unrecognized Japanese characters in object names with a numbered "JNAME" token.
	日本語でのデフォールトオブジェクトを英訳して、全角英数字を半角にして、残りの見分けられない日本語を「JNAME」+数字に変更します。

	WARNINGS: 
		The Flash library structure uses a dash "-" to delineate folders in names. Because of the way JSFL accesses the name property, I cut off names before the dash, so do not use them in object names!
		
		If you undo immediately after running the script, it will undo the renaming successfully, but it will also flatten your library's directory structure. This is another result of the above ugliness. Better to save first and revert if necessary.
